----------
Quickstart
----------

.. Required packages: python
.. Reccomended packages: tree (for pseudoschema), yajl (for verification)

----------
Motivation
----------

.. Ever tried to debug your laptop without an internet connection and not had the commands?

.. Ever stored a useful command for later in a text file and been unable to find it later?

.. restarting daemons, changing permissions, shell incompatibility

.. Security of shell commands, looking online ones.

.. Talk about composite commands versus component commands.

.. Talk about order of arguments.

------------
Design goals
------------

.. Talk about mergeability (use hashes of descriptions and commands, not arbitrary primary keys).

.. Talk about one-liners vs longer scripts.

.. Talk about extensibility of JSON fields without breaking.

.. Talk about component commands being the crucial distinction.
